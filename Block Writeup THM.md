We have to decrypt the SMB traffic and I found out how to do this by using this https://snynr.medium.com/tryhackme-encryption-what-encryption-2eff5ca2f065


You use the session keys from the python program provided in the article and decrypt the encrypted SMB traffic

What is the flag that the second user got access to?

`Answer : THM{No_PasSw0Rd?_No_Pr0bl3m}`


## Summary

I downloaded the files that I was given which had a DMP and a pcap file. I then used pypykatz on the dumpp and got the NTLM hashes and tried to crack them. I was able to get 
a password for the user "mrealman". Then I realized that it used encrypted SMB meaning that I would need to decrypt to find the flag. So what I Decide to do is search up how
to crack SMB encryption then I used the python program from the blog. It required the session key , username , domain , password or password hash ,and the ntproofstr. I did
this for both of the usernames I found in the pcap.I exported the csv files and found the flags in the files.
