We have to decrypt the SMB traffic and I found out how to do this by using this https://snynr.medium.com/tryhackme-encryption-what-encryption-2eff5ca2f065


You use the session keys from the python program provided in the article and decrypt the encrypted SMB traffic

## Summary

I downloaded the files that I was given which had a DMP and a pcap file. I then used pypykatz on the dumpp and got the NTLM hashes and tried to crack them. I was able to get 
a password for the user "mrealman". Then I realized that it used encrypted SMB meaning that I would need to decrypt to find the flag. So what I Decide to do is search up how
to crack SMB encryption then I used the python program from the blog. It required the session key , username , domain , password or password hash ,and the ntproofstr. I did
this for both of the usernames I found in the pcap.I exported the csv files and found the flags in the files.
